I build a LED thing in this project, I think the LED cube should be interesting and maybe can use in real life after project which someone links the cube with a sensor then make a night light.
I bought a LED kit on ICStation (www.icstation.com/).
ICStation 4x4x4 Light Cube kit uses 64 cuboid LED and controlled by Arduino. Expansion board uses two 74HC595 shift register chips, using eight I/O can light the 4x4x4 Light Cube, its hardware resources needed is less than other 4x4x4 light cubic expansion board (needs 20 I/O to control).

More info can found in Narrative file.

Week1</br>
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship</br>
I = V / R

Week2</br>
I am going to build a arduino Led cube, because I think it's interesting and can be useful(my daughter should be like it).</br>
This video are very useful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BlVUKW5hL0</br>
I bought a LEd kit from this website https://hobbyelectronics.co.nz/Home.php</br>
